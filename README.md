# Knuth-Morris-Pratt-KMP-Algorithm
The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm is a highly efficient string-searching algorithm used to find occurrences of a pattern string within a text string. It avoids unnecessary re-evaluation of characters by utilizing the information gained from previous comparisons, making it significantly faster than naive string matching algorithms.
